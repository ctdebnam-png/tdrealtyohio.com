## TASK 4: TRAVIS'S ABOUT PAGE BIO (COMPLETED)

**Location:** `/about.html`

**New Bio (345 words):**

I started TD Realty Ohio in 2017 because I believed there was a better way to help people buy and sell homes. The traditional 3% listing commission made sense decades ago when agents had to advertise in newspapers and host countless open houses to find buyers. Today, with MLS syndication pushing listings to every major real estate website instantly, those legacy costs don't justify legacy fees.

My background is in Central Ohio, and I've watched this market evolve over the years. I know which Westerville neighborhoods are walking distance to Uptown, which Powell developments feed into which Olentangy schools, and which Dublin addresses command premiums for good reason. That local knowledge matters when pricing your home or evaluating a purchase, and it's something you can't get from a national call center or algorithm.

When you work with TD Realty Ohio, you work directly with me. I'm the broker and owner, which means I make decisions without running them up a corporate ladder. If something needs to happen on a weekend or after hours, I'm available. There's no handoff to a junior agent or transaction coordinator who doesn't know your situation.

I include a free pre-listing inspection with every listing because I've seen too many deals fall apart when buyer inspections reveal surprises. Knowing your home's condition before you list lets you price accurately, address issues proactively, and negotiate from a position of strength. It's one of the ways I differentiate from competitors who charge the same low commission but offer less.

I live in Westerville with my family and serve clients throughout Central Ohio. If you're thinking about buying or selling a home in the Columbus metro area, I'd be happy to answer your questions.
