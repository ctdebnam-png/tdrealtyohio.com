              <p class="td-p">
                Our commission structure is straightforward. When you buy and sell with TD Realty Ohio, your listing commission is 1%.
                If you're only selling, the rate is 2%. With Powell's strong home values, the savings are significant.
                On a $500,000 Powell home, that's $5,000 to $10,000 in savings on the listing side alone compared to traditional 3% agents.

                Powell buyers often have high expectations - knowing your home's condition upfront helps avoid surprises and positions you for stronger negotiations.

              TD Realty Ohio charges 1% listing commission when you buy and sell with us, or 2% for sell-only listings. This applies to homes throughout Powell and Central Ohio.
