            <p class="td-p">
              If you're buying your first home in Dublin, TD Realty Ohio offers something no other local discount brokerage provides: 1% of your purchase price back at closing.
              On a $500,000 Dublin home, that's $5,000 in your pocket. Dublin's higher home values mean even greater cash back potential.
              Use it for closing costs, moving expenses, furniture, or anything you need.
              This benefit applies whether you're only buying or if you're selling a home and buying your first primary residence.
              Combined with our reduced listing commission, first-time buyers who also sell can maximize savings on both transactions.

              <p class="td-p">
                Our commission structure is straightforward. When you buy and sell with TD Realty Ohio, your listing commission is 1%.
                If you're only selling, the rate is 2%. With Dublin's higher home values, the savings are substantial.
                On a $600,000 Dublin home, that's $6,000 to $12,000 in savings on the listing side alone compared to traditional 3% agents.

                Every Dublin listing includes a professional home inspection before we go live on the MLS.
                This upfront knowledge lets you make informed decisions about repairs, pricing, and disclosures.
                It reduces surprises during buyer negotiations and positions you for stronger offers.
                Dublin buyers are often sophisticated and thorough - a pre-listing inspection demonstrates transparency.

              Dublin is one of Central Ohio's most desirable markets. Well-priced homes in good condition often receive offers within the first week or two. The total timeline from listing to closing typically ranges from 45-75 days depending on buyer financing and contract terms.
