                Every Gahanna listing includes a professional home inspection before we go live on the MLS.
                Many Gahanna homes were built in the 1970s-1990s and may have systems approaching update age.
                Knowing your home's condition upfront helps you price accurately and reduces surprises during buyer negotiations.
