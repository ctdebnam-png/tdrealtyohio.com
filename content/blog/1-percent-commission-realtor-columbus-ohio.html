      <h1>1% Commission Realtor Columbus Ohio: The Complete 2026 Guide</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">How to save thousands selling your Columbus home without sacrificing service</p>
      <p class="author">By Travis Debnam, Broker | TD Realty Ohio, LLC</p>
      <p class="date">Updated January 2026</p>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <p>If you're planning to sell your home in Columbus, Ohio, you've probably wondered if there's a way to keep more money in your pocket. The answer is yes—and it starts with finding a <strong>1% commission realtor in Columbus, Ohio</strong> who can provide full-service representation at a fraction of the traditional cost.</p>

      <p>At TD Realty Ohio, we've helped Central Ohio homeowners save thousands of dollars since 2017 by offering a 1% listing commission without cutting corners on service. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain exactly how 1% commission real estate works, what you should expect, and how to calculate your potential savings.</p>

      <p>Whether you're selling a starter home in Westerville or a luxury property in New Albany, understanding your commission options could mean the difference between walking away with $5,000, $10,000, or even $15,000 more at closing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-is-1-percent-commission">
      <h2>What Is a 1% Commission Realtor?</h2>

      <p>A 1% commission realtor is a licensed real estate agent or broker who charges only 1% of your home's final sale price as their listing fee. This is significantly less than the traditional 2.5-3% that most listing agents in Columbus charge.</p>

      <p>To put this in perspective:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Traditional 3% listing commission</strong> on a $400,000 home = $12,000</li>
        <li><strong>1% listing commission</strong> on the same home = $4,000</li>
        <li><strong>Your savings</strong> = $8,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That $8,000 stays in your pocket instead of going to your listing agent. And if you're buying your next home through the same 1% brokerage (like TD Realty Ohio), you could save even more through buyer rebates and incentives.</p>

      <h3>How Is This Different from Flat-Fee MLS?</h3>

      <p>It's important to understand the difference between a 1% commission realtor and flat-fee MLS services:</p>

      <p><strong>Flat-Fee MLS Services:</strong> You pay a fixed fee (often $300-$500) just to get your home listed on the MLS. After that, you're on your own for photos, showings, negotiations, and paperwork. This is essentially a DIY approach that can be risky for inexperienced sellers.</p>

      <p><strong>1% Commission Realtors:</strong> You get a licensed professional handling your entire transaction—from pricing strategy and professional photography to negotiating offers and coordinating closing. The only difference from traditional agents is the commission rate.</p>

      <p>At TD Realty Ohio, we believe you shouldn't have to choose between saving money and getting professional representation. That's why our 1% commission includes everything you'd expect from a traditional full-service agent. /sellers.html</p>
    </section>

    <section id="how-it-works">
      <h2>How Does 1% Commission Real Estate Work in Columbus?</h2>

      <p>When you list your home with a 1% commission realtor like TD Realty Ohio, the process is nearly identical to working with a traditional agent. The main difference? You pay less.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation and Pricing</h3>

      <p>We start with a free consultation to discuss your goals, timeline, and your home's value. Using comparative market analysis (CMA), we determine the optimal listing price to attract buyers while maximizing your return.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Preparing Your Home</h3>

      <p>Here's where TD Realty Ohio stands apart: <strong>we include a FREE pre-listing home inspection</strong> with every listing. This $400-$500 value helps you identify and address issues before buyers find them, leading to smoother negotiations and fewer deal failures. /pre-listing-inspection.html</p>

      <p>We also coordinate professional photography, virtual tours, and staging recommendations to ensure your home shows its best.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Marketing and MLS Listing</h3>

      <p>Your home gets maximum exposure through:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Columbus REALTORS MLS listing</li>
        <li>Syndication to Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and hundreds of other sites</li>
        <li>Professional photos and virtual tour</li>
        <li>Social media marketing</li>
        <li>Email marketing to our buyer network</li>
        <li>For-sale signage and lockbox</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 4: Showings and Open Houses</h3>

      <p>We coordinate all showings and can host open houses to generate buyer interest. You're never left to handle inquiries or tours on your own.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Offer Negotiation</h3>

      <p>When offers come in, we review each one with you, explain the terms, and negotiate to get you the best possible price and conditions. Our experience has helped Columbus sellers negotiate thousands more than the initial offer.</p>

      <h3>Step 6: Closing Coordination</h3>

      <p>From accepted offer to closing day, we manage inspections, appraisals, title work, and all the paperwork. You'll have a professional guiding you through every step.</p>

            <td>$16,500</td>
            <td>$5,500</td>
            <td><strong>$11,000</strong></td>

            <td><strong>$15,000</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These savings are real money that stays in your bank account at closing. For many Columbus families, this is enough to cover moving expenses, new furniture, or even a down payment boost on their next home.</p>

      <p><strong>TD Realty Ohio Commission Structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1% listing fee</strong> when you buy AND sell with us</li>
        <li><strong>2% listing fee</strong> when you're only selling (still a significant savings over 3%)</li>
        <li><strong>1% cashback</strong> to first-time homebuyers at closing /buyers.html</li>

      <h2>What's Included in TD Realty's 1% Commission?</h2>

      <p>Some sellers worry that a lower commission means lower service. At TD Realty Ohio, we include everything a traditional 3% agent provides—and then some:</p>

      <h3>Full-Service Representation Includes:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>FREE Pre-Listing Home Inspection</strong> (a $400-$500 value)</li>
        <li>Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) for accurate pricing</li>
        <li>Professional photography</li>
        <li>Virtual tour creation</li>
        <li>MLS listing with maximum exposure</li>
        <li>Syndication to 500+ real estate websites</li>
        <li>Yard sign and lockbox</li>
        <li>Showing coordination and scheduling</li>

        <li>Offer review and presentation</li>
        <li>Contract negotiation</li>
        <li>Inspection negotiation</li>
        <li>Closing coordination</li>
        <li>Transaction management through closing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The only thing missing? The inflated commission.</p>

      <h3>Why We Include a Free Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>

      <p>This is something no other 1% realtor in Columbus offers. By having your home inspected <em>before</em> listing, you can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fix issues before buyers discover them</li>
        <li>Price your home more accurately</li>
        <li>Avoid surprises during buyer inspections</li>
        <li>Negotiate from a position of strength</li>
        <li>Reduce the risk of deals falling through</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We've seen too many Columbus home sales collapse because of unexpected inspection issues. Our free pre-listing inspection helps ensure a smoother transaction for everyone. /pre-listing-inspection.html</p>

      <h2>Is a 1% Commission Realtor Right for You?</h2>

      <p>A 1% commission realtor is ideal for Columbus sellers who:</p>

      <ul>
