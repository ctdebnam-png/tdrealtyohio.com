    <section id="introduction">
      <p>Selling your Columbus home is exciting—until you realize how much of your equity goes to various costs. Understanding the true <strong>cost to sell a house in Columbus, Ohio</strong> helps you plan better and, importantly, identify opportunities to save.</p>

      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down every expense you might encounter when selling your Columbus-area home: agent commissions, closing costs, repairs, staging, and more. We'll also show you exactly how choosing a discount realtor like TD Realty Ohio can save you thousands without sacrificing service.</p>

      <p>Let's dive into the real numbers.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="total-cost-overview">
      <h2>Total Cost to Sell a House in Columbus: The Big Picture</h2>

      <p>Most Columbus sellers can expect to pay <strong>8-10% of their home's sale price</strong> in total selling costs. Here's the breakdown:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Expense Category</th>
            <th>Traditional Model</th>
            <th>With TD Realty</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Listing Agent Commission</td>
            <td>2.5-3%</td>
            <td>1-2%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Buyer's Agent Commission</td>
            <td>2.5-3%</td>
            <td>2.5-3% (negotiable)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Closing Costs</td>
            <td>1-3%</td>
            <td>1-3%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Pre-Sale Repairs/Prep</td>
            <td>1-2%</td>
            <td>1-2%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
            <td><strong>7-11%</strong></td>
            <td><strong>5.5-10%</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Example on a $400,000 Columbus home:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traditional costs: $28,000 - $44,000</li>
        <li>With TD Realty 1%: $22,000 - $40,000</li>
        <li><strong>Potential savings: $6,000 - $8,000</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now let's examine each category in detail.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="commission-costs">
      <h2>Real Estate Agent Commissions: The Biggest Variable</h2>

      <p>Agent commissions represent the largest selling cost—and the area where you have the most control. Understanding your options can save you thousands.</p>

      <h3>Traditional Commission Structure</h3>
      <p>Historically, Columbus sellers paid 5-6% total commission, split between listing and buyer's agents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Listing agent: 2.5-3% (paid by seller)</li>
        <li>Buyer's agent: 2.5-3% (traditionally paid by seller)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>On a $400,000 home, that's $20,000-$24,000 in commissions alone.</p>

      <h3>The 1% Commission Alternative</h3>
      <p>Full-service discount brokerages like TD Realty Ohio offer the same services at dramatically lower rates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1% listing fee</strong> when you buy AND sell with us</li>
        <li><strong>2% listing fee</strong> for sell-only clients</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Commission Savings Comparison ($400,000 home):</strong></p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Traditional 3% listing agent:</td>
          <td>$12,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TD Realty 1%:</td>
          <td>$4,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Your savings:</strong></td>
          <td><strong>$8,000</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Buyer's Agent Commission: What You Need to Know</h3>
      <p>Recent industry changes (NAR settlement) have made buyer's agent commission more negotiable. As a seller, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offer any amount to buyer's agents (including $0)</li>
        <li>Let buyers negotiate their own agent's compensation</li>
        <li>Continue offering traditional rates to attract more buyers</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> In the current Columbus market, offering a competitive buyer's agent commission (2-2.5%) typically results in more showings and stronger offers. The savings from lowering buyer's agent compensation often don't offset the potential for a lower sale price or longer time on market.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="closing-costs">
      <h2>Seller Closing Costs in Columbus, Ohio</h2>

      <p>Beyond commissions, sellers face various closing costs that typically total 1-3% of the sale price. Here's what to expect:</p>

      <h3>Title Insurance</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $1,000 - $2,500</strong> (varies with sale price)</p>
      <p>In Ohio, sellers typically pay for the owner's title insurance policy, which protects the buyer against title defects. This is a one-time fee based on the sale price.</p>

      <h3>Real Estate Transfer Tax</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $4.00 per $1,000 of sale price</strong> (Franklin County)</p>
      <p>Ohio charges a state conveyance fee, plus counties can add their own tax. In Franklin County (Columbus), the total is typically $4.00 per $1,000.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$300,000 home: $1,200</li>
        <li>$400,000 home: $1,600</li>
        <li>$500,000 home: $2,000</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prorated Property Taxes</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: Varies</strong></p>
      <p>You'll pay your share of property taxes up to the closing date. Columbus-area property taxes average 1.5-2% of home value annually, so budget accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Attorney Fees</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $300 - $600</strong></p>
      <p>While not required in Ohio, many sellers hire a real estate attorney to review documents. This is especially recommended for complex transactions.</p>

      <h3>Recording Fees</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $50 - $150</strong></p>
      <p>Administrative fees to record the deed transfer with the county.</p>

      <h3>Payoff Costs</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: Varies</strong></p>
      <p>If you have a mortgage, there may be fees to process the payoff, including wire transfer fees ($25-50) and any prepayment penalties (check your loan terms).</p>

      <h3>HOA Fees</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $100 - $500</strong></p>
      <p>If your property is in an HOA, expect fees for estoppel letters, transfer fees, and prorated dues.</p>

    <section id="pre-sale-costs">
      <h2>Pre-Sale Preparation Costs</h2>

      <p>Getting your home ready for sale can range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Here's where sellers typically spend:</p>

      <h3>Repairs and Maintenance</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $500 - $5,000+</strong></p>
      <p>Budget for fixing obvious issues: leaky faucets, broken fixtures, damaged flooring, etc. Major repairs (HVAC, roof, foundation) require careful cost-benefit analysis.</p>

      <p><strong>TD Realty Advantage:</strong> Our FREE pre-listing inspection identifies what actually needs repair before you spend money. Many sellers waste thousands on "improvements" that don't impact the sale, while missing inexpensive fixes that matter to buyers. [LINK: pre-listing-inspection]</p>

      <h3>Paint and Touch-Ups</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $500 - $3,000</strong></p>
      <p>Fresh, neutral paint is one of the best ROI improvements. Focus on high-traffic areas and any walls with bold colors that might turn off buyers.</p>

      <h3>Deep Cleaning</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $200 - $600</strong></p>
      <p>Professional cleaning makes a huge difference in buyer perception. Include carpet cleaning, window washing, and attention to kitchens/bathrooms.</p>

      <h3>Landscaping</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $200 - $1,500</strong></p>
      <p>Curb appeal matters. Fresh mulch, trimmed bushes, and a manicured lawn create positive first impressions.</p>

      <h3>Staging</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $0 - $3,000+</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>DIY staging with existing furniture: $0</li>
        <li>Consultation with stager: $200-$500</li>
        <li>Full staging (vacant home): $2,000-$5,000+/month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For most occupied Columbus homes, strategic decluttering and furniture rearrangement (free) is sufficient.</p>

      <h3>Home Warranty for Buyers</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $400 - $700</strong></p>
      <p>Some sellers offer a home warranty to buyers as a selling incentive. This is optional but can help attract offers on older homes.</p>

      <h3>Pre-Listing Home Inspection</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $400 - $500</strong> (FREE with TD Realty)</p>
      <p>Identifying issues before listing helps you price correctly and avoid surprises. TD Realty is the only Columbus discount broker that includes this at no charge.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="hidden-costs">
      <h2>Hidden and Often-Overlooked Costs</h2>

      <p>Beyond the obvious expenses, watch for these costs that catch sellers off guard:</p>

      <h3>Mortgage Payoff Balance</h3>
      <p>Your remaining mortgage balance comes out of sale proceeds. Make sure you know your current payoff amount (which includes accrued interest).</p>

      <h3>Concessions to Buyers</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: 0-3% of sale price</strong></p>
      <p>Buyers often request seller concessions for closing costs or repairs found during inspection. Budget 1-2% as a contingency.</p>

      <h3>Overlap/Carrying Costs</h3>
      <p>If you buy before selling (or carry the home longer than expected), you'll face double mortgage payments, utilities, insurance, etc. Each month of overlap on a $400,000 home might cost $3,000+.</p>

      <h3>Capital Gains Tax</h3>
      <p>If your profit exceeds $250,000 (single) or $500,000 (married filing jointly) and you've lived in the home 2+ of the last 5 years, you may owe capital gains tax. Most Columbus sellers don't hit these thresholds, but verify with a tax professional.</p>

      <h3>Moving Costs</h3>
      <p><strong>Cost: $1,000 - $5,000+</strong></p>
      <p>Local Columbus moves typically run $500-$2,000 for professional movers. Long-distance or large homes cost more.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="minimize-costs">
      <h2>How to Minimize Your Selling Costs</h2>

      <p>Here are proven strategies to keep more money in your pocket:</p>

      <h3>1. Choose a 1% Commission Realtor</h3>
      <p>The single biggest savings opportunity. On a $400,000 home, switching from 3% to 1% saves $8,000 while still getting full-service representation.</p>

      <h3>2. Get a Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>
      <p>Knowing your home's condition helps you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make only necessary repairs</li>
        <li>Price accurately</li>
        <li>Avoid post-inspection negotiation losses</li>
        <li>Prevent deals from falling through</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TD Realty includes this FREE—a $400-$500 value.</p>

      <h3>3. Price Right from the Start</h3>
      <p>Overpricing leads to price cuts, longer market time, and eventually accepting less than you would have with accurate pricing. Trust your agent's comparative market analysis.</p>

      <h3>4. Focus on High-ROI Improvements</h3>
      <p>Skip major renovations that rarely return full value. Instead:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh paint (especially neutral colors)</li>
        <li>Landscaping and curb appeal</li>
        <li>Minor kitchen updates (hardware, fixtures)</li>
        <li>Deep cleaning and decluttering</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Negotiate Concessions Strategically</h3>
      <p>Not every buyer request needs to be granted. An experienced agent helps you identify what's reasonable and push back on excessive demands.</p>

      <h3>6. Coordinate Sale and Purchase Timing</h3>
      <p>Minimize overlap by negotiating rent-backs, contingent offers, or timing closings strategically. TD Realty helps clients navigate this complexity daily.</p>
