    <section id="introduction">
      <p>Searching for <strong>discount real estate brokers in Columbus</strong>? You're not alone. With the median Columbus home now selling for over $300,000, traditional 6% total commissions can cost sellers $18,000 or more. That's money that could go toward your next down payment, moving costs, or simply staying in your pocket.</p>

      <p>But "discount real estate" covers a lot of ground—from bare-bones flat-fee MLS listings to full-service 1% brokerages. How do you know which model is right for your situation?</p>

      <p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll compare every type of discount real estate option available in Columbus, break down the pros and cons of each, and help you make an informed decision. Full disclosure: TD Realty Ohio is a full-service 1% commission brokerage, but we'll give you an honest look at all options—because the right choice depends on your specific needs.</p>

    <section id="discount-models-explained">
      <h2>Understanding the Different Discount Real Estate Models</h2>

      <p>Before comparing specific companies, let's understand the five main discount real estate models you'll encounter in Columbus:</p>

      <h3>1. Flat-Fee MLS Services</h3>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You pay a one-time fee (typically $300-$500) to get your home listed on the MLS. After that, you're essentially selling FSBO with MLS exposure.</p>

      <p><strong>What's included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>MLS listing entry</li>
        <li>Syndication to Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.</li>
        <li>Sometimes a yard sign</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What's NOT included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pricing guidance or CMA</li>
        <li>Professional photography</li>
        <li>Showing coordination</li>
        <li>Offer negotiation</li>
        <li>Contract preparation/review</li>
        <li>Closing coordination</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Experienced sellers comfortable handling their own transaction who just need MLS exposure.</p>

      <p><strong>Potential pitfalls:</strong> Pricing mistakes, negotiation losses, and legal issues can easily exceed any commission savings.</p>

      <h3>2. 1% Commission Brokerages (Full Service)</h3>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You pay 1% of your sale price for complete listing agent services. This is TD Realty Ohio's model.</p>

      <p><strong>What's included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything a traditional agent provides</li>
        <li>Professional photography and marketing</li>
        <li>Showing coordination</li>
        <li>Expert negotiations</li>
        <li>Closing support</li>
        <li>At TD Realty: FREE pre-listing inspection</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Sellers who want professional representation and significant savings without DIY hassles.</p>

      <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Ensure the brokerage truly offers full service—some "1% brokers" actually provide limited services.</p>

      <h3>3. 1.5% Commission Brokerages</h3>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> A middle-ground option charging 1.5% listing commission. Some national brands and local brokerages use this model.</p>

      <p><strong>What's included:</strong> Varies by company—could be full service or limited service.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Sellers in markets where 1% options don't exist or for higher-end homes where the company has a minimum fee.</p>

      <h3>4. 2% Commission Brokerages</h3>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> You pay 2% listing commission instead of the traditional 2.5-3%.</p>

      <p><strong>What's included:</strong> Usually full service, as the rate is only slightly below traditional.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Sellers who can't qualify for lower-tier rates (e.g., TD Realty's 2% rate for sell-only clients who aren't buying through us).</p>

      <h3>5. Hybrid/Tiered Models</h3>
      <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Companies offer different service levels at different price points. You might pay $999 for basic service or $2,999 for premium, regardless of home price.</p>

      <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Higher-priced homes where flat fees become much cheaper than percentage-based commissions.</p>

      <h2>Columbus Discount Real Estate Options: Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

      <p>Here's how the different models compare on a $400,000 Columbus home:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Model</th>
            <th>Listing Cost</th>

            <td>$300-$500</td>
            <td>MLS only</td>
            <td>Everything else</td>
            <td>High</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Limited Service 1%</td>
            <td>$4,000</td>
            <td>Basic</td>

            <td><strong>Nothing</strong></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1.5% Broker</td>
            <td>$6,000</td>
            <td>Full</td>
            <td>Nothing</td>
            <td>Low</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>TD Realty 2% (sell-only)</td>
            <td>$8,000</td>
            <td>Full + inspection</td>
            <td>Nothing</td>
            <td>Low</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Traditional 3%</td>
            <td>$12,000</td>
            <td>Full</td>
            <td>Nothing</td>
            <td>Low</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The gap between TD Realty's 1% full service and flat-fee MLS is $3,500-$3,700. But flat-fee sellers often lose more than this through pricing mistakes, negotiation losses, or deal problems. The "cheapest" option frequently isn't the best value.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-to-look-for">
      <h2>What to Look for in a Columbus Discount Broker</h2>

      <p>Not all discount brokers are created equal. Here's how to evaluate your options:</p>

      <h3>1. True Cost Breakdown</h3>
      <p>Ask for a complete list of all fees. Some "discount" brokers advertise low commissions but add fees for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Photography ($150-$400)</li>
        <li>Lockbox ($50-$100)</li>
        <li>Yard sign ($50-$100)</li>
        <li>Transaction coordination ($300-$500)</li>
        <li>Administrative fees ($200-$400)</li>
        <li>MLS listing fee ($50-$200)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A 1% commission with $1,000 in add-on fees is really 1.25%. Get the full picture before signing.</p>

      <h3>2. Service Inclusions</h3>
      <p>Specifically ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is professional photography included or DIY?</li>
        <li>Who handles showing requests—you or them?</li>
        <li>Will they personally present and negotiate offers?</li>
        <li>What happens if the deal hits problems during inspection or appraisal?</li>
        <li>Is closing coordination included?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Local Expertise</h3>
      <p>Columbus neighborhoods vary dramatically. A Westerville expert may not know Upper Arlington pricing nuances. Ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many homes have you sold in my specific area?</li>
        <li>What's your average sale-to-list price ratio?</li>
        <li>Can you provide references from my neighborhood?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Communication and Availability</h3>
      <p>Selling a home involves time-sensitive decisions. Ensure your discount broker:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responds promptly to inquiries</li>
        <li>Is available for showings and open houses</li>
        <li>Can be reached when offers come in (evenings/weekends)</li>
        <li>Communicates proactively, not just reactively</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Reviews and Track Record</h3>
      <p>Check Google reviews, Zillow reviews, and ask for references. Look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recent reviews (last 6-12 months)</li>
        <li>Reviews mentioning your specific area</li>
        <li>How the broker responds to negative reviews</li>
        <li>Patterns in feedback (good and bad)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
