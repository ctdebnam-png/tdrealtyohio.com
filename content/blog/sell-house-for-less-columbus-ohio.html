      <p class="subtitle">Save thousands on your home sale while still getting professional representation</p>

    <section id="introduction">
      <p>Every Columbus homeowner selling their property asks the same question: "How can I <strong>sell my house for less</strong> while still getting a good price?" The traditional 6% total real estate commission (split between listing and buyer's agents) can take a massive bite out of your equity—but it doesn't have to.</p>

      <p>In this guide, we'll explore every option for selling your Columbus, Ohio home for less, from FSBO to flat-fee MLS to discount brokerages like TD Realty Ohio. You'll learn which approaches actually save money (and which end up costing you more), plus how to calculate your real net proceeds.</p>

      <p>The good news? You can absolutely save thousands without doing it all yourself or accepting a lower sale price. Let's show you how.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="traditional-vs-discount">
      <h2>Traditional Real Estate Commissions vs. Discount Models</h2>

      <p>Before we dive into your options, let's understand what you're trying to save on. In a traditional Columbus home sale:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listing agent commission:</strong> 2.5-3% of sale price</li>
        <li><strong>Buyer's agent commission:</strong> 2.5-3% of sale price (often paid by seller)</li>
        <li><strong>Total:</strong> 5-6% of your home's value</li>
      </ul>

      <p>On a $400,000 Columbus home, that's $20,000-$24,000 in commissions alone. For many sellers, this exceeds their down payment on their next home.</p>

      <p>The discount real estate movement exists because sellers realized they have options. Here's the spectrum of what's available:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Your Cost</th>
            <th>Service Level</th>
            <th>Best For</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>FSBO (For Sale By Owner)</td>
            <td>$0-$500</td>
            <td>None (DIY)</td>
            <td>Experienced sellers with time</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Flat-Fee MLS</td>
            <td>$300-$500</td>
            <td>MLS listing only</td>
            <td>DIY sellers wanting MLS exposure</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Limited Service Agent</td>
            <td>1-1.5%</td>
            <td>Basic support</td>
            <td>Confident sellers needing some help</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Full-Service Discount (TD Realty)</strong></td>
            <td><strong>1-2%</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Full service</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Most sellers</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Traditional Agent</td>
            <td>2.5-3%</td>
            <td>Full service</td>
            <td>Complex situations</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>As you can see, full-service discount brokerages occupy the sweet spot: professional representation at a fraction of traditional costs.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="fsbo-reality">
      <h2>The FSBO Reality: Is Selling Without an Agent Worth It?</h2>

      <p>For Sale By Owner sounds appealing—pay no commission and keep all your equity. But before you plant that sign, consider the data:</p>

      <p><strong>According to the National Association of Realtors:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>FSBO homes sold for a median of $310,000 vs. $405,000 for agent-assisted sales in 2023</li>
        <li>Only 7% of home sales were FSBO</li>
        <li>FSBO sellers spent an average of 3 weeks longer on market</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now, some of this gap is due to FSBO sellers often knowing their buyers personally (family sales, etc.). But even accounting for that, studies consistently show FSBO homes sell for 5-7% less than comparable agent-listed properties.</p>

      <h3>Why FSBO Often Backfires</h3>

      <p><strong>Pricing mistakes:</strong> Without access to comparable sales data and market expertise, FSBO sellers often price too high (causing the home to sit) or too low (leaving money on the table).</p>

      <p><strong>Limited exposure:</strong> You can't list on the MLS without an agent or flat-fee service. This means missing 90%+ of buyers who search through their agents.</p>

      <p><strong>Negotiation disadvantages:</strong> Buyers and their agents know FSBO sellers lack representation. This often leads to lowball offers and aggressive inspection negotiations.</p>

      <p><strong>Legal complexity:</strong> Ohio real estate contracts are legally binding documents. One mistake can cost you thousands or even kill the deal.</p>

      <p><strong>Time investment:</strong> Responding to inquiries, scheduling showings, hosting open houses, qualifying buyers—it's essentially a part-time job.</p>

      <p>The math often doesn't work out. If FSBO costs you 5% in sale price, you've lost more than you "saved" on commission. That's why most sellers find that a discount realtor offers better net results.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="flat-fee-mls">
      <h2>Flat-Fee MLS: The Middle Ground (With Caveats)</h2>

      <p>Flat-fee MLS services let you list your home on the Columbus MLS for a one-time fee (typically $300-$500). Your listing then appears on Zillow, Realtor.com, and other sites, giving you exposure to buyers.</p>

      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>MLS listing with your photos and description</li>
        <li>Syndication to real estate websites</li>
        <li>Sometimes a yard sign</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What you don't get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pricing guidance</li>
        <li>Professional photography</li>
        <li>Showing coordination</li>
        <li>Offer negotiation</li>
        <li>Contract review</li>
        <li>Inspection negotiations</li>
        <li>Closing coordination</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Flat-fee MLS is essentially FSBO with better marketing. You're still handling everything yourself—you just have MLS exposure while doing it.</p>

      <p>This can work for experienced sellers who've been through multiple transactions. But for most Columbus homeowners, the learning curve and time investment make this option more costly than it appears.</p>

      <h3>Hidden Costs of Flat-Fee MLS</h3>

      <p>Consider these potential expenses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Professional photography: $150-$400</li>
        <li>Attorney review (recommended): $300-$500</li>
        <li>Pricing mistakes: Potentially thousands in lost value</li>
        <li>Negotiation losses: Often 1-3% of sale price</li>
        <li>Your time: Dozens of hours over weeks or months</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When you add these up, flat-fee MLS often costs as much as a 1% commission realtor—but without the professional support.</p>

      <h2>Discount Realtor Models: Understanding Your Options</h2>

      <p>The term "discount realtor" covers several different business models. Here's what you'll find in the Columbus market:</p>

      <h3>1. Limited-Service Discount Agents</h3>
      <p>Some discount agents offer a lower commission but provide fewer services. You might get MLS listing and basic paperwork, but limited marketing, showing support, or negotiation help. Always ask exactly what's included.</p>

      <h3>2. Volume-Based Discount Brokerages</h3>
      <p>These companies handle many transactions with a lean staff, passing savings to clients. Service quality varies—some are excellent, others feel like assembly lines. Research reviews carefully.</p>

      <h3>3. Full-Service 1% Commission Brokerages</h3>
      <p>This is TD Realty Ohio's model. We provide everything a traditional 3% agent does—professional photography, full marketing, showing coordination, expert negotiations, closing support—at a 1% commission rate (or 2% for sell-only clients).</p>

      <p>The key difference? We've built efficient systems that allow us to provide excellent service at lower costs. We don't cut corners; we cut overhead.</p>

      <h3>What to Ask Any Discount Realtor</h3>
      <p>Before signing with any discount brokerage, ask these questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Is professional photography included?</li>
        <li>Who handles showing requests and coordination?</li>
        <li>Will you personally negotiate offers, or am I on my own?</li>
        <li>Are there any additional fees beyond the stated commission?</li>
        <li>What's your experience in my specific neighborhood?</li>
        <li>Can I see reviews from recent clients?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="td-realty-approach">
      <h2>The TD Realty Ohio Approach: Full Service at 1%</h2>

      <p>At TD Realty Ohio, we believe Columbus homeowners shouldn't have to choose between saving money and getting quality service. That's why we've built a full-service brokerage at a 1% commission rate.</p>

      <p><strong>Our Commission Structure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1% listing fee</strong> when you buy AND sell with us</li>
        <li><strong>2% listing fee</strong> for sell-only clients (still 33% savings vs. 3%)</li>
        <li><strong>1% cashback</strong> to first-time homebuyers at closing /buyers.html</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>What's Included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>FREE pre-listing home inspection (no other Columbus discount broker offers this)</li>
        <li>Professional photography and virtual tours</li>
        <li>Full MLS listing with maximum exposure</li>
        <li>Syndication to Zillow, Realtor.com, and 500+ sites</li>
        <li>Showing coordination and scheduling</li>
        <li>Open house hosting (upon request)</li>
        <li>Expert offer analysis and negotiation</li>
        <li>Inspection negotiation support</li>
        <li>Full closing coordination</li>
        <li>Direct access to Broker Travis Debnam throughout</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why We Include a Free Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>

      <p>This is our secret weapon—and something no other discount broker in Columbus offers.</p>

      <p>A pre-listing inspection (normally $400-$500) identifies issues before buyers find them. This lets you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix problems proactively, on your timeline and budget</li>
        <li>Price your home accurately based on its true condition</li>
        <li>Avoid surprise repair requests during negotiations</li>
        <li>Reduce the risk of deals falling through</li>
        <li>Negotiate from a position of strength</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We've seen too many deals collapse over inspection surprises. The free pre-listing inspection protects your sale—and your bottom line. /pre-listing-inspection.html</p>

          <td><strong>Your savings:</strong></td>
          <td><strong>$11,000</strong></td>
        </tr>
