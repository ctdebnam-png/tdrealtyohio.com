    <section id="key-differences">
      <h2>Key Differences Explained</h2>

      <h3>The Free Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>
      <p>This is the most significant differentiator. TD Realty Ohio includes a professional home inspection (normally $400-$500) with every listing at no additional cost.</p>

      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You discover issues before buyers do</li>
        <li>You can fix problems on your timeline, with competitive quotes</li>
        <li>You avoid surprise negotiation demands that cost thousands</li>
        <li>You reduce the risk of deals falling through</li>
        <li>You negotiate from a position of knowledge, not reaction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Homes That Click does not include this service. You would need to pay for a pre-listing inspection separately if you wanted one.</p>

      <p>We believe the free pre-listing inspection often saves sellers more than its $400-$500 value through avoided negotiation losses and prevented deal failures. [LINK: pre-listing-inspection]</p>

      <h3>Commission Structure</h3>
      <p><strong>TD Realty Ohio:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1% listing commission when you buy AND sell with us</li>
        <li>2% listing commission for sell-only clients</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Homes That Click:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1% listing commission (verify current rates directly with them)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you're only selling (not buying), Homes That Click may offer a lower base rate. If you're both selling your current home and buying your next one, TD Realty's 1% rate applies and you get the free pre-listing inspection.</p>

      <h3>First-Time Homebuyer Benefits</h3>
      <p>TD Realty Ohio offers 1% cashback to first-time homebuyers at closing. This is separate from seller services but relevant if you're helping family members purchase or if you're selling to buy your first home.</p>

      <h3>Experience and Track Record</h3>
      <p>Homes That Click has operated in Columbus for 24+ years—a longer track record. TD Realty Ohio has served Central Ohio since 2017, building a solid reputation in that time. Both have local expertise and established operations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-both-include">
      <h2>What Both Companies Include</h2>

      <p>To be fair, both TD Realty Ohio and Homes That Click offer full-service representation that includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Professional photography</li>
        <li>MLS listing</li>
        <li>Syndication to major real estate websites</li>
        <li>Showing coordination</li>
        <li>Offer negotiation</li>
        <li>Closing coordination</li>
        <li>Local Columbus expertise</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Both represent legitimate alternatives to traditional 3% agents with meaningful savings for sellers.</p>

    <section id="who-should-choose">
      <h2>Who Should Choose Each Option?</h2>

      <h3>Consider TD Realty Ohio If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You want the security of a pre-listing inspection included</li>
        <li>You're both buying and selling (1% rate applies)</li>
        <li>You value working directly with the broker</li>
        <li>You have a first-time buyer in your household</li>
        <li>Your home might have issues you'd prefer to address proactively</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consider Homes That Click If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You're only selling (not buying) and want the lowest possible rate</li>
        <li>You prefer a company with a longer track record</li>
        <li>You've already had a pre-listing inspection done</li>
        <li>You know your home is in excellent condition with no surprises</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consider Either If:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You want to save thousands vs. traditional 3% agents</li>
        <li>You want full-service representation (not flat-fee DIY)</li>
        <li>You want a local Columbus professional, not a national call center</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="making-your-decision">
      <h2>Making Your Decision</h2>

      <p>We believe the fairest approach is to talk to both companies. Ask:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>What's your exact commission rate for my situation?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What services are included in that rate?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Are there any additional fees?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Who will I work with directly?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>What's your experience in my specific neighborhood?</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Can you provide references from recent clients?</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p>Both TD Realty Ohio and Homes That Click offer free consultations. Take advantage of both to see which feels like the better fit for your needs.</p>

    <section id="our-difference">
      <h2>Why We Include the Free Pre-Listing Inspection</h2>

      <p>At TD Realty Ohio, we've seen too many deals go sideways over inspection surprises. A buyer's inspector finds an issue, the buyer panics or demands excessive credits, and sellers end up paying far more than the repair would have cost.</p>

      <p>The free pre-listing inspection is our way of protecting clients from this scenario. Yes, it costs us $400-$500 per listing. But it saves our clients money, reduces stress, and leads to smoother transactions.</p>

      <p>We believe this protection is worth more than the commission difference between our services—especially if your home has deferred maintenance, is older, or if you simply want peace of mind.</p>
