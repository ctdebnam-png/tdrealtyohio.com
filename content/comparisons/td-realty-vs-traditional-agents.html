    <section id="introduction">
      <p>You're selling your Columbus home and wondering: should you go with a traditional 3% listing agent or a discount realtor like TD Realty Ohio at 1%? It's a fair question—and one that could mean thousands of dollars either way.</p>

      <p>In this honest comparison, we'll address the common concerns about discount real estate, show you exactly what's included at each price point, and help you decide what's right for your situation.</p>

      <p>Spoiler: For most Columbus home sellers, a full-service discount realtor offers the same results at significantly lower cost. But let's look at the details.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="the-math">
      <h2>The Math: What You'll Actually Save</h2>

      <p>Let's start with the numbers on a typical Columbus-area home:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Home Price</th>
            <th>Traditional 3%</th>
            <th>TD Realty 1%</th>
            <th>Your Savings</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>$300,000</td>
            <td>$9,000</td>
            <td>$3,000</td>
            <td><strong>$6,000</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>$400,000</td>
            <td>$12,000</td>
            <td>$4,000</td>
            <td><strong>$8,000</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>$500,000</td>
            <td>$15,000</td>
            <td>$5,000</td>
            <td><strong>$10,000</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>$600,000</td>
            <td>$18,000</td>
            <td>$6,000</td>
            <td><strong>$12,000</strong></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>These are real dollars that either go to your listing agent or stay in your pocket. The question is: what are you getting for that extra $6,000-$12,000 with a traditional agent?</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> TD Realty Ohio provides everything a traditional agent does—plus a free pre-listing inspection—at one-third the cost.</p>

    <section id="common-objections">
      <h2>Addressing Common Concerns About Discount Realtors</h2>

      <h3>"You get what you pay for"</h3>
      <p><strong>The concern:</strong> Lower commission must mean lower quality service.</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> This assumes commission rate equals service quality. It doesn't. TD Realty provides the same professional marketing, MLS access, and expert negotiation as traditional agents. The savings come from efficient operations, not cut corners.</p>

      <p>In fact, our free pre-listing inspection provides protection that most traditional agents don't offer at any price.</p>

      <h3>"My home will sell for less"</h3>
      <p><strong>The concern:</strong> Discount agents won't work as hard, resulting in a lower sale price.</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Your home's sale price is determined by the market, not your agent's commission rate. Both discount and traditional agents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List on the same MLS</li>
        <li>Syndicate to the same websites</li>
        <li>Reach the same buyer pool</li>
        <li>Use the same comparable sales data for pricing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A well-priced home in good condition sells at market value regardless of whether the listing agent charges 1% or 3%.</p>

      <h3>"Buyer's agents won't show my home"</h3>
      <p><strong>The concern:</strong> Agents will steer buyers away from discount-listed homes.</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> The listing commission (what you pay TD Realty) is separate from the buyer's agent commission. You can offer whatever buyer's agent commission you choose—typically 2-2.5% in Columbus.</p>

      <p>Buyer's agents are compensated the same whether your listing agent charges 1% or 3%. They have no financial reason to avoid your listing.</p>

      <h3>"I won't get the same attention"</h3>
      <p><strong>The concern:</strong> Discount agents take on too many clients and spread themselves thin.</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> At TD Realty Ohio, you work directly with Broker Travis Riddle. There's no hand-off to assistants or transaction coordinators. Every listing receives personal attention because our business model depends on satisfied clients and referrals.</p>

      <h3>"There must be hidden fees"</h3>
      <p><strong>The concern:</strong> The low commission is offset by add-on charges.</p>

      <p><strong>The reality:</strong> TD Realty Ohio has no hidden fees. Our 1% (or 2% for sell-only) includes all standard services. No photography fees, no admin fees, no transaction fees. The quoted commission is your complete listing cost.</p>

      <p>(Note: Some discount brokerages do charge extras—always ask for a complete fee breakdown before signing with any agent.)</p>
    </section>

    <section id="when-traditional-makes-sense">
      <h2>When a Traditional Agent Might Make Sense</h2>

      <p>We believe discount realtors serve most sellers well. However, there are situations where a traditional agent might be worth the extra cost:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex situations:</strong> Estate sales, divorces, short sales, or properties with legal complications may benefit from agents who specialize in these areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique properties:</strong> Ultra-luxury homes, historic properties, or unusual properties might need specialized marketing networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Existing relationships:</strong> If you have a trusted agent who's helped you before, that relationship has value.</li>
        <li><strong>Specific expertise needs:</strong> Some sellers need agents with particular knowledge (commercial conversion, land development, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For the typical Columbus home sale, however, a full-service discount realtor provides equivalent service at significant savings.</p>

      <h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>

      <p>[TESTIMONIAL PLACEHOLDER 1]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"We were skeptical about using a discount realtor, but TD Realty provided better service than the 3% agent we used on our previous home. The free pre-listing inspection was a game-changer—we fixed a few issues and avoided any surprises during the buyer's inspection. We saved $7,500 in commission and had a completely smooth transaction."</p>
        <cite>— [CLIENT NAME], Westerville</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[TESTIMONIAL PLACEHOLDER 2]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Travis was more responsive and hands-on than any agent we've worked with. The fact that we paid 1% instead of 3% made no difference in service quality—if anything, we got more attention. Our home sold in 8 days at full asking price."</p>
        <cite>— [CLIENT NAME], Dublin</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>[TESTIMONIAL PLACEHOLDER 3]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I interviewed three traditional agents and TD Realty. The traditional agents couldn't explain what I'd get for the extra $9,000 in commission. TD Realty offered everything they did—plus the inspection—at a third of the cost. Easy decision."</p>
        <cite>— [CLIENT NAME], Powell</cite>

    <section id="the-td-realty-advantage">
      <h2>The TD Realty Advantage: More Than Just Lower Commission</h2>

      <p>While saving money is important, our real value goes beyond the commission rate:</p>

      <h3>Free Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>
      <p>This $400-$500 value protects your sale by identifying issues before buyers do. You avoid surprise negotiation demands and deal failures. Most traditional agents don't offer this at any commission rate. [LINK: pre-listing-inspection]</p>

      <h3>Direct Broker Access</h3>
      <p>You work directly with Broker Travis Riddle—not handed off to junior agents or transaction coordinators. When decisions need to be made, you're talking to the decision-maker.</p>

      <p>We know Columbus neighborhoods, pricing trends, and buyer preferences. This knowledge helps price your home correctly and market it effectively.</p>

      <h3>Buyer Benefits Too</h3>
      <p>First-time homebuyers purchasing through TD Realty receive 1% cashback at closing. If you're buying and selling, you benefit on both transactions.</p>
