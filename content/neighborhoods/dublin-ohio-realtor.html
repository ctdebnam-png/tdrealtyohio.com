      <h1>1% Commission Realtor Dublin Ohio</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Premium Service for Dublin's Premium Market—At a Fraction of Traditional Commission</p>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction">
      <p>Dublin, Ohio represents some of the finest real estate in Central Ohio—and with that comes higher home values and higher commission costs if you use a traditional agent. On a typical Dublin home, you could pay $13,500 or more in listing commission alone.</p>

      <p>TD Realty Ohio offers Dublin homeowners a smarter choice: <strong>1% commission realtor</strong> service with full professional representation. Same expertise, same marketing, same results—thousands less in fees.</p>

      <p>Whether you're selling in Historic Dublin, the vibrant Bridge Park area, or an established golf course community, we deliver the service Dublin sellers expect while keeping more equity in your pocket.</p>
