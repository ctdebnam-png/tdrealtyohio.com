            <h2>Buying in Grove City?</h2>
            <p>Grove City is one of Central Ohio's best values for first-time homebuyers. With a median price around $300,000, you can find quality homes with more space than you'd get in many other Columbus suburbs. TD Realty Ohio's first-time buyer cash back program puts 1% of the purchase price back in your pocket at closing. On a $300,000 home, that's $3,000 to help with your move or closing costs.</p>
            <p>Grove City offers easy access to downtown Columbus, growing retail and entertainment options, and a strong sense of community centered around the Town Center. Whether you're buying your first home, upgrading to more space, or looking for value in the Columbus market, we'll help you find the right Grove City property and negotiate the best possible terms.</p>
