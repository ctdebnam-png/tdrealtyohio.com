        <p>Considering a 1% commission realtor for your home sale? Here's exactly what to expect when working with TD Realty Ohio.</p>

        <h2>The Initial Consultation</h2>
        <p>Your first meeting covers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your goals:</strong> Timeline, where you're moving, any constraints</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing strategy:</strong> Comparative market analysis of similar Columbus sales</li>
            <li><strong>Commission explanation:</strong> Clear breakdown of costs with no hidden fees</li>
            <li><strong>Process overview:</strong> What happens from listing to closing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This consultation is free with no obligation. You'll leave knowing exactly what your home might sell for and what you'll net after costs.</p>

        <h2>Listing Agreement</h2>
        <p>Once you decide to proceed, you'll sign a listing agreement specifying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Commission rate: 1% (if buying and selling) or 2% (sell only)</li>
            <li>Listing duration (typically 6 months)</li>
            <li>Services included</li>
            <li>Any offered buyer agent compensation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pre-Listing Preparation</h2>
        <p>What happens before your home goes live:</p>
        
        <h3>Pre-Listing Inspection</h3>
        <p>TD Realty Ohio schedules a professional home inspection. You'll receive a detailed report of your home's condition—the same comprehensive inspection buyers typically order. This is included at no extra cost.</p>

        <h3>Professional Photography</h3>
        <p>High-quality photos are scheduled. This isn't smartphone shots—it's professional real estate photography that showcases your home on Zillow, Realtor.com, and the Columbus MLS.</p>

        <h3>Listing Creation</h3>
        <p>Your broker creates compelling listing descriptions highlighting your home's best features and the local area.</p>

        <h2>Active Marketing</h2>
        <p>Once listed, your home receives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MLS exposure:</strong> Listed on Columbus REALTORS® MLS</li>
            <li><strong>Syndication:</strong> Automatic distribution to Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and hundreds of other sites</li>
            <li><strong>Online advertising:</strong> Targeted digital marketing</li>
            <li><strong>Showing coordination:</strong> All requests managed professionally</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Showings and Feedback</h2>
        <p>Your broker coordinates all showings and communicates feedback. You'll know what buyers think and can adjust strategy if needed.</p>

        <h2>Offer Negotiation</h2>
        <p>When offers come in, your broker:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviews all terms—not just price</li>
            <li>Explains strengths and weaknesses of each offer</li>
            <li>Negotiates on your behalf</li>
            <li>Helps you make informed decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contract to Close</h2>
        <p>After accepting an offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contract management and deadline tracking</li>
            <li>Coordination with buyer's agent, lender, and title company</li>
            <li>Inspection navigation (much smoother with pre-listing inspection)</li>
            <li>Problem-solving if issues arise</li>
            <li>Final walkthrough and closing coordination</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Different From Traditional Agents?</h2>
        <p>Honestly? Not much in terms of service. The key differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> You pay significantly less commission</li>
            <li><strong>Direct access:</strong> You work with the broker, not assistants</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-listing inspection:</strong> Most traditional agents don't include this</li>
            <li><strong>No frills:</strong> We focus on what sells homes, not flashy but ineffective marketing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Selling with a 1% commission agent like TD Realty Ohio means getting full professional service while keeping more of your equity. The process is the same—only the cost to you is different.</p>
