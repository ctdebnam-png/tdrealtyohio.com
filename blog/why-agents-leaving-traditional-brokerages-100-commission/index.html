          <h1>Why Agents Are Leaving Traditional Brokerages for 100% Commission Models</h1>
          <p class="post-meta">By Travis Debnam | January 20, 2025</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p>The traditional real estate brokerage model has worked the same way for decades. An agent closes a deal, the commission comes in, and the brokerage takes 20-30% off the top. Sometimes more. The agent gets what's left.</p>

          <p>That model made sense when brokerages provided significant value: office space, administrative support, lead generation, marketing materials, training, and brand recognition that helped agents get clients. Twenty years ago, agents needed those things.</p>

          <p>The industry has changed. Many agents no longer need—or use—what traditional brokerages provide. Yet they're still paying for it through commission splits, desk fees, franchise fees, and technology charges.</p>

          <p>That's why more agents are moving to 100% commission models. Here's what's driving the shift and what to consider if you're thinking about making a change.</p>

          <h2>The Traditional Split Model: What You're Actually Paying For</h2>

          <p>At a traditional brokerage with an 80/20 split, the math on a $400,000 transaction at 2.5% commission ($10,000 gross) looks like this: the agent keeps $8,000, the brokerage keeps $2,000.</p>

          <p>Do that 12 times a year and you've given your brokerage $24,000. At a 70/30 split, it's $36,000.</p>

          <p>What does that buy you? In theory: office space, broker support, marketing, technology, training, and brand recognition. In practice, many experienced agents use little of this. They work from home or their car. They generate their own leads through referrals and their personal network. They do their own marketing. They've been through the training and don't need more.</p>

          <p>The brand name on the business card? It matters less than it used to. Consumers search for homes on Zillow and Realtor.com, not on brokerage websites. Reviews and referrals drive business more than corporate branding.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, that $24,000-$36,000 per year goes to pay for the brokerage's office lease, administrative staff, franchise fees to corporate, and profit margins. The agent is subsidizing infrastructure they don't use.</p>

          <h2>What 100% Commission Models Offer</h2>

          <p>A 100% commission brokerage operates with lower overhead. No expensive office space. No franchise fees flowing to a national corporation. No layers of management. The savings go to the agents.</p>

          <p>At a 100% commission brokerage like TD Realty Ohio, an agent keeps the full $10,000 on that same $400,000 listing. On buyer sides, TD Realty's 90% split means the agent keeps $9,000 instead of $8,000.</p>

          <p>The difference adds up. An agent doing 12 transactions per year keeps an extra $12,000-$24,000 compared to traditional splits. That's real money—a car payment, a family vacation, retirement savings, or reinvestment in the business.</p>

          <h2>Who 100% Commission Works For</h2>

          <p>The 100% commission model isn't right for everyone. It works best for agents who are self-sufficient and don't need extensive support infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Experienced agents who generate their own business benefit most. If you have a pipeline of referrals and repeat clients, you don't need the brokerage to find you leads. If you know how to price homes, write contracts, and navigate transactions, you don't need daily training. If you work from home or meet clients at coffee shops, you don't need an office.</p>

          <p>New agents can also benefit, but in a different way. Without desk fees and monthly minimums, a new agent can get started without bleeding money before they close their first deal. The learning curve is steeper without extensive training programs, but some agents prefer to learn by doing rather than sitting in classrooms.</p>

          <p>The model doesn't work as well for agents who need significant support: extensive training, daily mentorship, office presence, team environments, or lead generation from the brokerage. If those things drive your business, a traditional brokerage might provide better value despite the higher cost.</p>

          <h2>What to Look for Beyond Commission</h2>

          <p>Commission split matters, but it's not the only factor. When evaluating a brokerage—whether 100% commission or traditional—consider these elements:</p>

          <p><strong>Broker accessibility.</strong> When you have a question about a contract or a complicated transaction, can you reach the broker? At some large brokerages, the broker is a distant figure. At others, you get direct phone access. This matters when you need guidance at 7pm on a Friday before a deadline.</p>

          <p><strong>Compliance support.</strong> Real estate has significant legal and regulatory requirements. A good brokerage provides compliance oversight that protects you from mistakes that could cost your license or trigger lawsuits.</p>

          <p><strong>E&O coverage.</strong> Errors and omissions insurance is essential. Some brokerages include it; others require you to obtain your own. Factor this into your cost comparison.</p>

          <p><strong>Technology.</strong> What tools does the brokerage provide? MLS access is standard, but what about transaction management, e-signatures, marketing platforms? Some 100% brokerages provide these; others expect you to bring your own.</p>

          <p><strong>Culture and values.</strong> Even at a low-overhead brokerage, the broker's approach matters. Are they focused on agent success or just collecting transaction fees? Do they operate ethically and maintain a good reputation in the market?</p>

          <p><strong>Hidden fees.</strong> Some "100% commission" brokerages charge transaction fees, technology fees, or monthly platform fees that erode the benefit. Understand the full cost structure before committing.</p>

          <h2>The Local vs. National Question</h2>

          <p>100% commission brokerages come in different forms. Some are national virtual brokerages. Others are local independent operations.</p>

          <p>National virtual brokerages offer scale and sometimes stock incentives or referral networks. But they're often based elsewhere, with brokers who don't know your local market. When you need guidance on Columbus-specific practices or relationships with local title companies, a broker in another state may not be much help.</p>

          <p>Local independent brokerages like TD Realty Ohio offer the same commission benefits with local market knowledge. The broker lives and works in the same market you do. They know the local title companies, the inspection practices, the market dynamics. When something unusual comes up in a transaction, they have relevant experience.</p>

          <p>Neither approach is universally better. It depends on what you value and how much local support matters to your business.</p>

          <h2>Making the Transition</h2>

          <p>If you're considering switching from a traditional brokerage to a 100% commission model, think through these practical considerations:</p>

          <p><strong>Contract obligations.</strong> Review your current brokerage agreement. What are the notice requirements? Are there any holdover periods for pending transactions or clients you're currently working with?</p>

          <p><strong>Pending deals.</strong> What happens to transactions currently in progress? Plan the timing of your switch to minimize complications.</p>

          <p><strong>Marketing materials.</strong> You'll need new business cards, signs, and online profiles. Budget time and money for the transition.</p>

          <p><strong>Client communication.</strong> Your sphere of influence and past clients need to know how to reach you. Plan how you'll communicate the change without violating any agreements with your current brokerage.</p>

          <p><strong>MLS and association memberships.</strong> These are typically tied to your brokerage. Confirm how the transfer process works and whether there's any gap in access.</p>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>The traditional brokerage model served a purpose when agents needed what brokerages provided. For many agents today, that's no longer the case. They're paying for services they don't use while the industry has evolved around them.</p>

          <p>100% commission models offer an alternative: keep more of what you earn, operate with lower overhead, and run your business the way you want. The tradeoff is less support infrastructure, which works fine for self-sufficient agents but may not suit everyone.</p>

          <p>If you're an agent in Central Ohio wondering whether the math makes sense for you, <a href="/agents/">TD Realty Ohio</a> offers 100% on listings and 90% on buyer sides with no desk fees, franchise fees, or monthly minimums. We're a local brokerage, not a national franchise, which means the broker actually knows the Columbus market.</p>

          <p>The conversation is free. The math is straightforward. If you want to explore whether a 100% commission model fits your business, reach out.</p>
