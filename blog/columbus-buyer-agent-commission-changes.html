        <p>The real estate industry has undergone significant changes following the 2024 NAR settlement. Here's what Columbus buyers and sellers need to understand.</p>

        <h2>What Changed?</h2>
        <p>The 2024 settlement resulted in several key changes:</p>
        
        <h3>For Buyers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Buyers must sign written agreements with their agents before touring homes</li>
            <li>These agreements specify what the buyer will pay their agent</li>
            <li>Buyer agent compensation is no longer automatically offered through the MLS</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Sellers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sellers are no longer required to offer compensation to buyer's agents through the MLS</li>
            <li>Sellers can still choose to offer buyer agent compensation (and many do)</li>
            <li>How compensation is communicated and negotiated has changed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What This Means in Columbus</h2>
        <p>In practice, the Columbus market has adapted:</p>

        <h3>Most Sellers Still Offer Buyer Agent Compensation</h3>
        <p>While no longer required, most Columbus sellers continue offering compensation to buyer's agents. Why? It attracts more potential buyers and their agents, typically resulting in better sale outcomes.</p>

        <h3>Compensation Is More Negotiable</h3>
        <p>The standard 3% buyer agent compensation is no longer assumed. Sellers can offer 2%, 2.5%, or negotiate based on their situation.</p>

        <h3>More Transparency</h3>
        <p>Everyone involved now has clearer understanding of who pays what. This transparency benefits consumers.</p>

        <h2>Strategies for Columbus Sellers</h2>

        <h3>Option 1: Offer Standard Buyer Agent Compensation</h3>
        <p>Continue offering 2.5-3% to buyer's agents. This maintains maximum buyer exposure and is still the most common approach in Columbus.</p>

        <h3>Option 2: Offer Reduced Compensation</h3>
        <p>Offer less (2% or lower) and let buyers negotiate with their agents. Some buyers may cover any shortfall themselves.</p>

        <h3>Option 3: Offer No Compensation</h3>
        <p>Possible but potentially limits buyer pool. Buyers would need to pay their agent directly or negotiate for the seller to pay at closing.</p>

        <div class="blog-callout">
            <p><strong>TD Realty Ohio Approach:</strong> We discuss buyer agent compensation strategy with each seller based on their specific property, market conditions, and goals. There's no one-size-fits-all answer.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>For Columbus Buyers</h2>
        <p>Key things to understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You'll sign a buyer agency agreement before touring homes</li>
            <li>Your agreement will specify your agent's compensation</li>
            <li>If the seller offers compensation, it typically covers your agent's fee</li>
            <li>If the seller doesn't offer enough, you may need to make up the difference</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>While the rules have changed, the fundamentals haven't. Buyers still need representation, sellers still want maximum exposure, and agents still facilitate transactions. The main difference is more transparency about who pays what—which ultimately benefits everyone.</p>
