    <article class="blog-content">
        
        <p>You've seen the ads: "Sell your home for just 1% commission!" But is it too good to be true? Here's an honest look at what 1% commission realtors offer Columbus sellers.</p>

        <h2>What Is a 1% Commission Realtor?</h2>
        <p>A 1% commission realtor charges 1% of your home's sale price for listing services, compared to the traditional 3%. On a $400,000 Columbus home, that's $4,000 instead of $12,000—a savings of $8,000.</p>

        <h2>How Can They Charge Less?</h2>
        <p>Lower commission doesn't necessarily mean worse service. Many 1% brokerages save money through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower overhead:</strong> No expensive office space or large staff</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Efficient systems reduce administrative time</li>
            <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Some brokerages handle more transactions at lower margins</li>
            <li><strong>Direct service:</strong> Working without layers of assistants</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At TD Realty Ohio, our 1% rate (when you buy and sell) comes from operating efficiently. You work directly with a licensed broker—no handoffs to assistants or junior agents.</p>

        <h2>What to Watch For</h2>
        <p>Not all low-commission options are equal. Ask about:</p>

        <h3>Hidden Fees</h3>
        <p>Some discount brokerages advertise low commission but add administrative fees, marketing fees, or transaction fees that reduce your savings. At TD Realty Ohio, our rate is all-inclusive.</p>

        <h3>Service Level</h3>
        <p>What exactly is included? Full-service should mean professional photography, MLS listing, marketing, negotiation, and transaction management. Anything less is a discount service, not just a lower commission.</p>

        <h3>Agent Experience</h3>
        <p>Is the agent a licensed broker or a newer salesperson? How many transactions have they completed? Experience matters in pricing, negotiation, and problem-solving.</p>

        <h3>Direct Access</h3>
        <p>Will you work directly with the agent, or be handed to assistants and call centers? Personal attention matters when selling your largest asset.</p>

        <h2>The TD Realty Ohio Difference</h2>
        <p>Here's what you get with our 1% commission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Licensed broker handling your transaction personally</li>
            <li>Pre-listing home inspection included</li>
            <li>Professional photography</li>
            <li>Full MLS listing and syndication</li>
            <li>Strategic marketing</li>
            <li>Expert negotiation</li>
            <li>Complete transaction management</li>
            <li>No hidden fees or surprise charges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When 1% Makes Sense</h2>
        <p>A 1% commission agent is worth it when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You receive full-service representation</li>
            <li>The agent is experienced and responsive</li>
            <li>There are no hidden fees</li>
            <li>You're comfortable with the agent's communication style</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Be Cautious</h2>
        <p>Be careful if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Services are vague or limited</li>
            <li>There are multiple add-on fees</li>
            <li>You can't speak directly with your agent</li>
            <li>The agent seems overwhelmed with too many listings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>A 1% commission realtor can absolutely be worth it—if you choose carefully. Focus on the total value: services provided, agent experience, and responsiveness. The commission rate tells you the cost, but the agent's quality determines whether you're getting a good deal.</p>
