          <h1>First-Time Homebuyers: Get 1% Cash Back at Closing</h1>
          <p class="post-meta">By Travis Debnam | January 2026 | 8 min read</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p class="lead">Buying your first home is exciting, but the costs can add up quickly. Between the down payment, closing costs, moving expenses, and new furniture, first-time buyers often feel financially stretched before they even get the keys. That's why TD Realty Ohio offers a 1% cash back program exclusively for first-time homebuyers in Central Ohio.</p>

          <h2>What Is the 1% Cash Back Program?</h2>

          <p>When you purchase a home as a first-time buyer with TD Realty Ohio as your buyer's agent, you receive 1% of the purchase price back at closing. This money comes from the buyer's agent commission that the seller typically pays, so it costs you nothing extra.</p>

          <p>Here's how it works: When a home sells, the seller usually pays a commission that gets split between the listing agent and the buyer's agent. Rather than keeping the entire buyer's agent commission, TD Realty Ohio shares a portion of it with you. It's a straightforward way to put more money in your pocket during one of life's biggest purchases.</p>

          <h2>Cash Back Examples at Different Price Points</h2>

          <p>The cash back amount scales with your purchase price. Here's what you could receive on homes at various price points common in the Columbus market:</p>

          <div style="background: var(--gray-50); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
              <thead>

                  <th style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">Your Cash Back (1%)</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

          <h2>Who Qualifies as a First-Time Homebuyer?</h2>

          <p>The term "first-time homebuyer" is broader than many people realize. You may qualify even if you've owned property before. Generally, you're considered a first-time homebuyer if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>You've never owned a home</strong> - The most straightforward qualification</li>
            <li><strong>You haven't owned in the past three years</strong> - If you owned a home but have been renting for at least three years, you typically qualify again</li>
            <li><strong>You're a displaced homemaker</strong> - Someone who worked in the home providing unpaid services for family members and owned only with a spouse</li>
            <li><strong>You're a single parent</strong> - Someone who only owned property with a former spouse while married</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you're unsure whether you qualify, <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> and we'll help you determine your eligibility. Many people who assume they don't qualify are pleasantly surprised to learn they do.</p>

          <h2>How Can You Use the Cash Back?</h2>

          <p>One of the best things about the cash back program is its flexibility. Depending on your lender's guidelines, you can use the rebate in several ways:</p>

          <h3>Apply Toward Closing Costs</h3>
          <p>Closing costs typically run 2-5% of the purchase price. Your 1% cash back can significantly offset these expenses, which include lender fees, title insurance, escrow deposits, and attorney fees. For a $350,000 home with $10,000 in closing costs, your $3,500 cash back would cover more than a third of those expenses.</p>

          <h3>Cover Prepaid Items</h3>
          <p>At closing, you'll prepay certain items like property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and mortgage interest. The cash back can be applied to these costs, reducing the amount you need to bring to the closing table.</p>

          <h3>Receive as a Credit</h3>
          <p>In some cases, depending on your loan program and lender, you may be able to receive the cash back as a credit that reduces your out-of-pocket costs. This effectively puts money back in your pocket that you can use for furniture, appliances, moving expenses, or building an emergency fund.</p>

          <h3>Common Ways First-Time Buyers Use Their Cash Back</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>New furniture for empty rooms</li>
            <li>Appliances not included with the home</li>
            <li>Professional moving services</li>
            <li>Minor repairs or updates</li>
            <li>Building an emergency home repair fund</li>
            <li>Landscaping or outdoor improvements</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Home Buying Process with TD Realty Ohio</h2>

          <p>Working with TD Realty Ohio as a first-time buyer is straightforward. Here's what the process looks like:</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Initial Consultation</h3>
          <p>We start with a no-obligation conversation about your goals, timeline, and budget. This is where we explain the cash back program in detail and answer your questions. We'll also discuss neighborhoods, school districts, and what to expect in the current Columbus market.</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Get Pre-Approved</h3>
          <p>Before searching for homes, you'll want a pre-approval letter from a lender. This tells you exactly how much house you can afford and makes your offers more competitive. We can recommend lenders familiar with first-time buyer programs and down payment assistance options.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Search and Tour Homes</h3>
          <p>Using your criteria, we'll set up automated searches so you're notified when matching homes hit the market. We schedule showings quickly in Columbus's competitive market, often within 24-48 hours of your request.</p>

          <h3>Step 4: Make an Offer</h3>
          <p>When you find the right home, we'll prepare a competitive offer based on comparable sales, market conditions, and the seller's situation. As a first-time buyer, we'll explain every section of the purchase contract so you understand exactly what you're agreeing to.</p>

          <h3>Step 5: Under Contract</h3>
          <p>Once your offer is accepted, we coordinate inspections, appraisal, and work with your lender to keep everything on track. This is typically a 30-45 day period where we're managing deadlines and troubleshooting any issues that arise.</p>

          <h3>Step 6: Closing</h3>
          <p>At closing, you'll sign the final documents, receive the keys, and get your cash back. The rebate is typically shown as a credit on your closing disclosure, reducing the amount you owe at the closing table.</p>

          <h2>Full Service, Not Discount Service</h2>

          <p>Some first-time buyers worry that a cash back program means reduced service. That's not the case with TD Realty Ohio. You receive the same comprehensive buyer representation you'd get from any full-service agent:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Access to all MLS listings and off-market opportunities</li>
            <li>Professional guidance on neighborhoods, schools, and market conditions</li>
            <li>Expert offer preparation and negotiation</li>
            <li>Coordination of inspections and repairs</li>
            <li>Management of all contract deadlines</li>
            <li>Communication with lenders, title companies, and other parties</li>
            <li>Guidance through closing and beyond</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The cash back comes from our commission, not from reduced service. We believe first-time buyers deserve both excellent representation and help with their costs.</p>

                <p>Buyer rebates are legal in Ohio and most lenders allow them. However, some loan programs have restrictions on how much can be credited at closing. We work with your lender to structure the rebate in a way that maximizes your benefit within their guidelines.</p>

The cash back comes from the buyer's agent commission, so it costs you nothing extra.</p>
