          <h1>How Much Can You Save Selling Your Columbus Home for 1% Commission?</h1>
          <p class="post-meta">By Travis Debnam | January 15, 2026</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p>If you're planning to sell your home in Columbus, Ohio, one of the biggest expenses you'll face is the real estate commission. Traditionally, home sellers pay around 3% of the sale price to their listing agent. But what if you could cut that cost by two-thirds?</p>

          <p>At <a href="/sellers.html">TD Realty Ohio</a>, we offer full-service listing representation for just 1-2% commission, depending on whether you're also buying a home. In this article, I'll break down exactly how much you can save and what you get for that lower rate.</p>

          <h2>The Math: 1% vs 3% Commission on Columbus Homes</h2>

          <p>Let's start with the numbers. The listing agent commission is calculated as a percentage of your home's sale price. Here's how 1% compares to the traditional 3%:</p>

          <p><strong>Example: $350,000 home (approximate Columbus median)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Traditional 3% listing commission: $10,500</li>
            <li>TD Realty Ohio 1% commission: $3,500</li>
            <li><strong>Your savings: $7,000</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>That's $7,000 more equity in your pocket. For many Columbus families, that's a significant chunk of a down payment on their next home, moving expenses, or simply money saved for other priorities.</p>

          <h2>Commission Savings Table: $200K to $800K</h2>

          <p>To help you understand your potential savings, here's a breakdown across different price points common in the Columbus market:</p>

          <div style="overflow-x: auto; margin: 2rem 0;">

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p><em>Note: This table shows 1% commission (sell and buy with TD Realty). Sell-only clients pay 2%, which still saves you 1% compared to traditional rates.</em></p>

          <h2>What's Included in TD Realty Ohio's 1-2% Commission?</h2>

          <p>A lower commission doesn't mean less service. Here's what every TD Realty Ohio seller receives:</p>

          <h3>Full MLS Listing and Syndication</h3>
          <p>Your home is listed on the Columbus REALTORS MLS and automatically syndicated to Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, Trulia, and hundreds of other real estate websites. This gives your listing the same exposure as any traditionally-priced listing.</p>

          <h3>Professional Photography</h3>
          <p>High-quality photos are essential for attracting buyers online. Professional photography is included with every listing to showcase your home at its best.</p>

          <h3>Showing Coordination</h3>
          <p>I coordinate all showings, working with your schedule to make the process convenient. You don't have to field calls from agents or manage appointments yourself.</p>

          <h3>Expert Negotiation</h3>
          <p>When offers come in, I handle all negotiations on your behalf. My goal is to get you the best possible price and terms. This includes negotiating repairs after inspection, managing multiple offers, and navigating counteroffers.</p>

          <h3>Contract to Close Management</h3>
          <p>From accepted offer to closing day, I manage every detail: coordinating with the title company, monitoring deadlines, ensuring contingencies are met, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.</p>

          <h3>Free Pre-Listing Home Inspection</h3>
          <p>This is a significant value-add that most agents don't offer. Before listing your home, I arrange for a licensed inspector to examine the property. This inspection, typically valued at $400-500, is included at no additional cost to you.</p>

          <p>The <a href="/pre-listing-inspection.html">pre-listing inspection</a> helps you understand your home's condition before buyers do. You can choose to make repairs, adjust your pricing, or disclose issues upfront. Either way, you avoid the surprise of a buyer's inspection derailing your sale at the last minute.</p>

          <h2>Why a Pre-Listing Inspection Is Valuable</h2>

          <p>Many Columbus home sales hit snags during the buyer's inspection period. The buyer discovers issues, requests thousands in repairs or credits, and suddenly your proceeds are reduced far more than any commission savings.</p>

          <p>A pre-listing inspection gives you the power of knowledge. You can:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fix issues before listing</strong> - Address problems on your timeline, get competitive bids, and maintain control</li>
            <li><strong>Price accurately</strong> - Factor known issues into your asking price rather than negotiating down later</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce negotiation surprises</strong> - Buyers have fewer opportunities to renegotiate when you've already addressed or disclosed issues</li>
            <li><strong>Speed up closing</strong> - Fewer inspection-related delays means a smoother path to the closing table</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This free inspection alone can save you more than the commission difference, making TD Realty Ohio's 1-2% rate even more valuable.</p>

          <h2>How Does TD Realty Offer Lower Commissions?</h2>

          <p>You might wonder how a full-service agent can charge so much less. The answer is straightforward: efficiency and lower overhead.</p>

          <p>Unlike large brokerages with expensive office space, administrative staff, and franchise fees, TD Realty Ohio operates with minimal overhead. I'm an independent broker who handles transactions personally, using technology to work efficiently. These savings get passed directly to you.</p>

          <p>I don't cut corners on service. I simply don't have the overhead costs that require charging 3% to make a living. It's a better deal for both of us.</p>

          <h2>1% vs 2% Commission: Which Do You Qualify For?</h2>

          <p>TD Realty Ohio offers two commission tiers:</p>

          <p><strong>1% Commission:</strong> Available when you both sell and buy with TD Realty Ohio. If you're selling your current Columbus home and purchasing another home in Central Ohio, this rate applies. You save on both transactions.</p>

          <p><strong>2% Commission:</strong> For sell-only clients who aren't purchasing a replacement home through TD Realty Ohio. This still saves you 1% compared to traditional 3% agents.</p>

          <p>Even at 2%, you're keeping thousands more in equity. On a $400,000 home, that's $4,000 in savings compared to a traditional listing agent.</p>

          <h2>What About the Buyer's Agent Commission?</h2>

          <p>It's important to understand that the listing agent commission (what we've been discussing) is separate from any compensation offered to buyer's agents. Following recent industry changes, how buyer's agents are compensated has become more flexible.</p>

          <p>As your listing agent, I'll explain all your options and help you make competitive decisions for the <a href="/areas/">Columbus market</a>. The goal is to attract qualified buyers while keeping your total costs as low as possible.</p>

          <h2>Is a Low Commission Realtor Right for You?</h2>

          <p>A 1% commission realtor makes sense for Columbus sellers who:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Want to maximize their equity without sacrificing service quality</li>
            <li>Are comfortable working with a smaller, independent brokerage</li>
            <li>Value direct communication with their listing agent (no assistants or teams)</li>
            <li>Appreciate the added value of a free pre-listing inspection</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you want the traditional big-brokerage experience with brand name recognition, TD Realty Ohio might not be for you. But if you care more about results and keeping more of your money, let's talk.</p>

                <p>Buyer's agent compensation is negotiated separately from the listing commission. Following recent industry changes, this is now typically negotiated between buyers and their agents.

                <p>TD Realty Ohio charges 1% listing commission when you both sell and buy with them (using their services for two transactions). For sell-only clients, the commission is 2%. Both rates are significantly below the traditional 3% listing commission.</p>
