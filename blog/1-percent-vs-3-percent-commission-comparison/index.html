          <p class="post-meta">By Travis Debnam | January 2026 | 10 min read</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p class="lead">When selling your home, one of the biggest decisions you'll make is choosing a listing agent. For decades, the standard listing commission has been around 3%, but a growing number of agents now offer rates of 1-2%. The question many sellers ask is: what's the catch? Is a discount realtor worth it, or will you end up sacrificing service and sales price?</p>

          <p>As a broker who offers 1-2% listing commissions in Central Ohio, I hear these questions regularly. Let me break down the real differences, debunk some common myths, and help you understand when each option might make sense.</p>

          <h2>The Math: What You Actually Save</h2>

          <p>Before diving into services, let's look at the actual dollar amounts at stake. The difference between 1% and 3% might seem small in percentage terms, but it adds up quickly:</p>

          <div style="background: var(--gray-50); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
              <thead>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--gray-200);">
                  <th style="text-align: left; padding: 0.75rem 0;">Sale Price</th>
                  <th style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">3% Commission</th>
                  <th style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">1% Commission</th>
                  <th style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">Your Savings</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200);">
                  <td style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">$300,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$9,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$3,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0; color: var(--success); font-weight: 600;">$6,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200);">
                  <td style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">$400,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$12,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$4,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0; color: var(--success); font-weight: 600;">$8,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200);">
                  <td style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">$500,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$15,000</td>

                </tr>
                <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--gray-200);">

                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$18,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$6,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0; color: var(--success); font-weight: 600;">$12,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="padding: 0.75rem 0;">$750,000</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$22,500</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0;">$7,500</td>
                  <td style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem 0; color: var(--success); font-weight: 600;">$15,000</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: var(--gray-600); margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 0;">Note: These figures represent listing agent commission only. Buyer's agent compensation is negotiated separately.</p>
          </div>

          <p>These savings go directly to your bottom line. On a $500,000 home, the $10,000 difference between 1% and 3% could cover your moving costs, make a significant dent in your next home's down payment, or simply stay in your bank account.</p>

          <h2>What Services Do You Actually Get?</h2>

          <p>The common assumption is that lower commission means fewer services. Let's compare what you typically receive at each level:</p>

          <h3>Core Services (Included at Any Commission Level by Quality Agents)</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>MLS Listing</strong> - Your home appears on the Multiple Listing Service, which feeds to Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and hundreds of other sites</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Photography</strong> - High-quality photos are non-negotiable in today's market</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing Strategy</strong> - Comparative market analysis to price your home competitively</li>
            <li><strong>Showing Coordination</strong> - Managing buyer visits and feedback</li>
            <li><strong>Offer Review and Negotiation</strong> - Evaluating offers and negotiating on your behalf</li>
            <li><strong>Contract Management</strong> - Handling paperwork, deadlines, and contingencies</li>
            <li><strong>Closing Coordination</strong> - Working with title companies, lenders, and other parties</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What TD Realty Ohio Includes at 1-2%</h3>

          <p>At TD Realty Ohio, our 1-2% commission includes everything above plus:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Pre-Listing Inspection</strong> - Know your home's condition before buyers do, allowing you to price accurately and avoid negotiation surprises</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Tour Options</strong> - 3D tours and video for online buyers</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Lockbox</strong> - Secure showing access with digital tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Agent Access</strong> - You work directly with the broker, not a team member</li>
            <li><strong>Electronic Signature</strong> - Convenient digital document signing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What Some 3% Agents Might Add</h3>

          <p>Higher-commission agents sometimes justify their rates with extras like:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Professional staging (though many charge separately anyway)</li>
            <li>Larger advertising budgets (but online exposure is largely equal through MLS)</li>
            <li>Open houses (effectiveness is debatable; most buyers today find homes online)</li>
            <li>Printed brochures and mailers (less impactful in the digital age)</li>
            <li>Larger teams (which can mean less personal attention)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The question to ask: Are these extras worth $8,000-$15,000 more? For most sellers, the answer is no.</p>

          <h2>Debunking Common Myths About Discount Agents</h2>

          <h3>Myth 1: "Your Home Will Sell for Less"</h3>

          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Sale price is determined by market conditions, property condition, location, and pricing strategy, not by the listing commission. A home priced right with quality photos and full MLS exposure will attract the same buyers regardless of what the listing agent charges.</p>

          <p>Multiple studies have failed to find a correlation between commission rates and sale prices. What matters is having a skilled negotiator who understands the market, and that's about the individual agent's expertise, not their fee structure.</p>

          <h3>Myth 2: "Discount Agents Don't Work as Hard"</h3>

          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Low-commission agents often work smarter, not less. They use efficient systems, leverage technology, and focus on providing essential services that actually sell homes. Many have streamlined their businesses to cut overhead costs rather than cutting corners on service.</p>

          <p>In fact, some high-commission agents with large teams may give you less personal attention because they're juggling many clients to support their overhead costs.</p>

          <h3>Myth 3: "Buyer's Agents Won't Show Your Home"</h3>

          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This myth stems from confusion about how commission works. The listing commission (what you pay your agent) is separate from what the buyer's agent receives. At TD Realty Ohio, we typically recommend offering competitive buyer's agent compensation to maximize showings.</p>

          <p>Buyer's agents are legally obligated to show homes that meet their clients' criteria. The listing agent's commission has no impact on whether buyers see your home through Zillow, Realtor.com, or any other platform.</p>

          <h3>Myth 4: "You Get What You Pay For"</h3>

          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> This common saying doesn't always apply to real estate commissions. The 3% standard was established decades ago when marketing a home required expensive print advertising and limited reach. Today, MLS exposure gives every listing equal visibility online.</p>

          <p>What you should pay for is expertise, negotiation skills, and responsive service, and those qualities exist at every commission level. Check reviews, ask for references, and interview agents to evaluate their competence.</p>

          <h2>How Low-Commission Agents Make It Work</h2>

          <p>You might wonder how an agent can offer quality service at 1-2% when others charge 3%. Here's how TD Realty Ohio does it:</p>

          <h3>Lower Overhead</h3>
          <p>We don't maintain expensive office space or support large administrative teams. Technology has made it possible to run an efficient brokerage without the overhead that gets passed on to clients.</p>

          <h3>Efficient Systems</h3>
          <p>From digital document signing to automated showing feedback, we use technology to streamline processes. This lets us handle transactions efficiently without sacrificing quality.</p>

          <h3>Direct Broker Service</h3>
          <p>When you work with TD Realty Ohio, you work directly with the broker, not a junior agent. This eliminates layers of communication and ensures experienced guidance throughout your transaction.</p>

          <h3>Volume Efficiency</h3>
          <p>By offering competitive rates, we can work with more clients while still providing excellent service. This sustainable model benefits both the agent and the client.</p>

          <h2>When a Traditional Agent Might Make Sense</h2>

          <p>While I obviously believe in the value of low-commission service, there are situations where a traditional agent might be worth considering:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unusual or luxury properties</strong> that require specialized marketing beyond standard MLS exposure</li>
            <li><strong>Sellers who need significant hand-holding</strong> and aren't comfortable making decisions independently</li>
            <li><strong>Properties requiring extensive networking</strong> to find the right buyer (commercial, investment, unique use cases)</li>
            <li><strong>Existing relationships</strong> with a trusted agent who has specific knowledge of your situation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For the vast majority of residential sales in Central Ohio, though, a quality low-commission agent provides everything you need at a fraction of the cost.</p>

          <h2>Questions to Ask Any Agent, Regardless of Commission</h2>

          <p>Whether you're interviewing a 1% agent or a 3% agent, ask these questions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>What specific services are included in your commission?</strong> Get a detailed list, not vague promises.</li>
            <li><strong>How many transactions have you completed in my area?</strong> Local experience matters.</li>
            <li><strong>Can I see reviews from recent clients?</strong> Past performance predicts future service.</li>
            <li><strong>How will you price my home?</strong> Look for data-driven analysis, not just optimistic numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>What's your communication style?</strong> Make sure it matches your expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Will I work directly with you or a team member?</strong> Know who's actually handling your sale.</li>
            <li><strong>What happens if my home doesn't sell?</strong> Understand the listing agreement terms.</li>
          </ol>

                Will my home sell for less with a 1% agent?

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Research does not support the claim that homes listed with low-commission agents sell for less. Sale price is determined by market conditions, property condition, pricing strategy, and marketing reach, all of which a quality low-commission agent provides. What matters is having full MLS exposure and a skilled negotiator, not the commission rate.</p>

                What's the difference between flat-fee MLS and a low-commission agent?

              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Flat-fee MLS services typically only list your home on the MLS for a one-time fee. You handle showings, negotiations, and paperwork yourself. A low-commission agent like TD Realty Ohio provides full-service representation including pricing strategy, professional photography, showing coordination, negotiations, and guidance through closing.</p>

                How much can I save with a 1% listing commission?
                <svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">

              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>On a $400,000 home, a 1% commission is $4,000 compared to $12,000 at 3%, a savings of $8,000. On a $500,000 home, the savings would be $10,000. This is just the listing side; buyer agent compensation is negotiated separately.</p>

              <button class="faq-question">
                When might a traditional 3% agent make more sense?
                <svg class="faq-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
                  <polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"/>
                </svg>
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>A traditional agent might be worth considering for unusual properties requiring specialized marketing, if you need significant hand-holding through the process, or if you have a relationship with a specific agent you trust. However, many sellers find that the services provided by quality low-commission agents meet all their needs.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>The real difference between 1% and 3% commission isn't about service quality; it's about business models. Traditional agents justify their rates with extras that may or may not benefit you, while low-commission agents have streamlined their operations to pass savings directly to sellers.</p>

          <p>For most Columbus-area home sellers, a quality low-commission agent provides everything needed to sell successfully while keeping thousands of dollars in your pocket. The key is finding an experienced agent, regardless of their commission rate, who will advocate for your interests and guide you through the process.</p>
