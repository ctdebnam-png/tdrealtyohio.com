        <p>Most home inspections happen after a buyer makes an offer. But what if you knew your home's condition before listing? Here's why Columbus sellers should consider a pre-listing inspection.</p>

        <h2>What Is a Pre-Listing Inspection?</h2>
        <p>A pre-listing inspection is a professional home inspection conducted before you put your home on the market. The same comprehensive evaluation buyers order—but you get the results first.</p>

        <h2>Benefits for Columbus Sellers</h2>

        <h3>1. No Surprises</h3>
        <p>The inspection contingency period is when many deals fall apart. Buyers discover issues and demand repairs, credits, or price reductions. With a pre-listing inspection, you know exactly what's there before any buyer does.</p>

        <h3>2. Price Accurately</h3>
        <p>Knowing your home's true condition allows you to price it correctly from day one. No guessing about whether that furnace will pass inspection or whether the roof needs attention.</p>

        <h3>3. Make Repairs on Your Terms</h3>
        <p>If issues are found, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix them before listing (often at lower cost than emergency repairs)</li>
            <li>Get multiple contractor quotes</li>
            <li>Choose quality contractors rather than whoever's available fastest</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Stronger Negotiating Position</h3>
        <p>When buyers know the home has been pre-inspected and issues addressed, they have less leverage to negotiate price reductions. Full disclosure upfront builds trust and reduces haggling.</p>

        <h3>5. Faster Closings</h3>
        <p>Deals with fewer inspection surprises close more smoothly. Buyers feel confident, lenders encounter fewer issues, and everyone stays on schedule.</p>

        <h2>What Gets Inspected?</h2>
        <p>A pre-listing inspection covers the same items as a buyer's inspection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roof and exterior</li>
            <li>Foundation and structure</li>
            <li>Electrical systems</li>
            <li>Plumbing</li>
            <li>HVAC</li>
            <li>Interior condition</li>
            <li>Attic and insulation</li>
            <li>Safety concerns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cost vs. Value</h2>
        <p>A pre-listing inspection typically costs $400-$500 in Columbus. This investment can save thousands by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preventing last-minute price renegotiations</li>
            <li>Allowing proactive repairs at fair prices</li>
            <li>Reducing days on market</li>
            <li>Preventing deals from falling through</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What If Problems Are Found?</h2>
        <p>Discovering issues isn't bad news—it's valuable information. For each issue, you can:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Repair it:</strong> Fix the problem before listing</li>
            <li><strong>Price accordingly:</strong> Adjust your asking price to reflect the condition</li>
            <li><strong>Disclose and move on:</strong> List as-is with full disclosure</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your agent can help you decide which approach makes the most financial sense for each issue.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>A pre-listing inspection gives you control. You know what you're selling, buyers know what they're buying, and everyone can proceed with confidence. For most Columbus sellers, it's a smart investment in a smoother sale.</p>
