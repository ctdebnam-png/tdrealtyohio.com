        <p>Selling a home in Columbus doesn't have to cost a fortune. With smart decisions, many sellers can save $10,000 or more. Here's how.</p>

        <h2>Strategy 1: Choose a Low-Commission Listing Agent</h2>
        <p>This is the single biggest way to save money. Traditional agents charge 3% to list your home. TD Realty Ohio charges just 1% (when you buy and sell) or 2% (sell only).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Savings on a $500,000 home:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional 3%: $15,000</li>
            <li>TD Realty Ohio 1%: $5,000</li>
            <li><strong>Your savings: $10,000</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="blog-callout">
            <p>This single decision can save you $10,000 while still receiving full-service representation including professional photography, MLS listing, marketing, and expert negotiation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Strategy 2: Price Correctly From Day One</h2>
        <p>Overpriced homes sit on the market, eventually selling for less than if they'd been priced correctly initially. Work with an agent who provides honest pricing guidance based on comparable Columbus sales.</p>

        <h2>Strategy 3: Get a Pre-Listing Inspection</h2>
        <p>Knowing your home's condition before listing allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make strategic repairs on your terms</li>
            <li>Price accurately to reflect condition</li>
            <li>Avoid surprise negotiation demands from buyers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TD Realty Ohio includes a pre-listing inspection with every listing—a $400-500 value that can save thousands in last-minute negotiations.</p>

        <h2>Strategy 4: Make Smart Repairs Only</h2>
        <p>Not every improvement pays off. Focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High ROI:</strong> Fresh paint, landscaping, deep cleaning</li>
            <li><strong>Necessary repairs:</strong> Fix obvious issues that will come up in inspections</li>
            <li><strong>Skip:</strong> Major renovations that won't return full cost</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy 5: Time Your Sale Strategically</h2>
        <p>In Columbus, spring and early summer typically see the most buyer activity. Listing during peak season can mean faster sales and stronger offers—reducing carrying costs and potential price reductions.</p>

        <h2>Strategy 6: Negotiate Closing Costs</h2>
        <p>Some closing costs are negotiable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Title company selection (shop around)</li>
            <li>Attorney fees (if using one)</li>
            <li>Home warranty (some sellers skip this)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Potential Savings</h2>
        <table class="blog-table">
            <tr><th>Strategy</th><th>Potential Savings</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1% vs 3% listing commission</td><td>$4,000-$12,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Correct pricing (avoid reductions)</td><td>$5,000-$15,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Pre-listing inspection (avoid demands)</td><td>$2,000-$5,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Strategic repairs only</td><td>$1,000-$3,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Total Potential Savings</strong></td><td><strong>$12,000-$35,000</strong></td></tr>
        </table>
