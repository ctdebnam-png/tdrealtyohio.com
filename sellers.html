                The sell only listing commission is 2%.

                The 2% fee still provides substantial savings compared to traditional 3% listing fees.

            <div class="td-faq-a">
              We operate with an efficiency focused model and streamlined process compared to some traditional brokerages. Technology and standardized workflows reduce time and overhead, which supports reduced listing commission structures. Use a consultation to confirm the fee path that applies to your timeline.

          </div>

          <div class="td-faq-item" data-td-faq-item>

              <span>+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="td-faq-a">
              The 1% rate applies when you sell your current home and purchase your next home with TD Realty Ohio. If you are only selling, the listing rate is 2%. Both options are intended to provide full service representation with clear terms discussed during the consultation.
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="td-faq-item" data-td-faq-item>

              <span>+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="td-faq-a">
              These rates refer to the listing side only. Buyer side compensation is negotiated separately and depends on the listing strategy and the terms you accept. Discuss your plan during the consultation so the listing agreement reflects what you intend to offer.

              <span>+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="td-faq-a">
              A pre-listing inspection gives you information earlier so you can choose a path. Options can include making repairs before listing, adjusting pricing, or disclosing issues so buyers can evaluate them during offers. The goal is to reduce surprises and improve decision making before negotiations.
