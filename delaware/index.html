            <p class="td-p">
              If you're buying your first home in Delaware, TD Realty Ohio offers something no other local discount brokerage provides: 1% of your purchase price back at closing.
              On a $350,000 Delaware home, that's $3,500 in your pocket. Delaware offers excellent value compared to communities further south, and this cash back makes homeownership even more accessible.
              Use it for closing costs, moving expenses, furniture, or anything you need.
              Combined with our reduced listing commission, first-time buyers who also sell can maximize savings on both transactions.

                New construction and established neighborhoods both contribute to a diverse inventory.

                Single-family homes dominate the market, with ranch homes, two-story colonials, and split-levels all represented.
                Pricing tends to be more accessible than communities like Dublin or Powell, making Delaware attractive for first-time buyers and families seeking space.
                The pre-listing inspection we include helps ensure accurate pricing whether you're selling a century home with character or a newer suburban build.

                On a $400,000 Delaware home, that's $4,000 to $8,000 in savings on the listing side alone.
