              If you're buying your first home in Columbus, TD Realty Ohio offers something no other local discount brokerage provides: 1% of your purchase price back at closing.
              On a $350,000 home, that's $3,500 in your pocket. Use it for closing costs, moving expenses, furniture, or anything you need.
              This benefit applies whether you're only buying or if you're selling a home and buying your first primary residence.
              Combined with our reduced listing commission, first-time buyers who also sell can maximize savings on both transactions.

                Columbus is Ohio's capital and largest city, with a population exceeding 900,000 in the city proper and over 2 million in the metropolitan area.
                Located in central Ohio, the city serves as the county seat of Franklin County, though the metro area extends into Delaware, Fairfield, Licking, Madison, Pickaway, and Union counties.
                Columbus is home to The Ohio State University, one of the largest university campuses in the nation, which significantly influences the local economy, culture, and housing market.
              </p>
              <p class="td-p" style="margin-top: 12px;">
                Major highways including I-70 (east-west), I-71 (northeast-southwest), and the I-270 outerbelt provide access throughout the region.
                I-670 connects downtown to Port Columbus International Airport (John Glenn Columbus International), making the city accessible for business travelers and relocations.

                German Village, one of the largest privately-funded historic preservation districts in the nation, offers brick streets and restored 19th-century homes.
                Clintonville provides tree-lined streets and walkable access to parks and local shops.
                Grandview Heights and Upper Arlington offer established suburban communities close to downtown.
                Victorian Village, Italian Village, and the emerging Franklinton area provide additional options for buyers seeking urban living with character.

                Major employers including Nationwide Insurance, Cardinal Health, L Brands, Huntington Bank, and Ohio State University provide economic stability.
                The city's relatively affordable cost of living compared to coastal metros continues to attract relocations from higher-cost regions.
                Inventory levels vary by neighborhood and price point, with some areas experiencing competitive conditions where well-priced homes attract multiple offers.

                Columbus offers everything from historic homes in German Village and Victorian Village to new construction in emerging areas like Franklinton.
                Single-family homes dominate the suburban markets, while condos and townhomes are common in urban neighborhoods and near OSU campus.
                Pricing varies significantly by location: urban neighborhoods like Short North and German Village command premiums, while outlying areas offer more space at lower price points.
                The pre-listing inspection we include helps ensure accurate pricing whether you're selling a century home with character or a newer suburban build.

              <p class="td-p">
                Our commission structure is straightforward. When you buy and sell with TD Realty Ohio, your listing commission is 1%.
                If you're only selling, the rate is 2%. Both options represent significant savings compared to the traditional 3% listing fee charged by many Columbus agents.
                On a $400,000 Columbus home, that's $4,000 to $8,000 in savings on the listing side alone.

                Every Columbus listing includes a professional home inspection before we go live on the MLS.

                It reduces surprises during buyer negotiations and positions you for stronger offers.
                No other 1% commission brokerage in Columbus includes this service.

            </button>
            <div class="td-faq-a">
              TD Realty Ohio charges 1% listing commission when you buy and sell with us, or 2% for sell-only listings. This applies to homes throughout Columbus and Central Ohio. Both options include full MLS service and a pre-listing inspection. The buyer side commission is negotiated separately and depends on the terms you choose.

            <div class="td-faq-a">
              Yes, every listing with TD Realty Ohio includes a pre-listing inspection at no additional cost. This inspection helps you identify and address potential issues before listing, supports accurate pricing, and reduces surprises during buyer negotiations. The inspection report becomes a tool for transparency rather than a source of unexpected repair requests after you're already under contract.

            <div class="td-faq-a">
              Market conditions vary by neighborhood and price point, but well-priced Columbus homes in good condition often receive offers within the first few weeks. The total timeline from listing to closing typically ranges from 45-75 days depending on buyer financing and contract terms. Properties that need more preparation or are priced above market may take longer. We'll provide realistic timing expectations during your consultation.
